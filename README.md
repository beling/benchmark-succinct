The program (by Piotr Beling) for benchmarking the succinct data structures contained in the [SDSL](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite) library.
It mimics (by the way it draws data, measures time, etc.) the cseq_benchmark program included in [BSuccinct](https://github.com/beling/bsuccinct-rs).
Consequently, the results obtained by the two programs can be compared.
